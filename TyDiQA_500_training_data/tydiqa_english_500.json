Patent Office (a caveat was a notice of intention to file a patent application. It was like a patent application, but without a request for examination, for the purpose of notifying the patent office of a possible invention in process). 14 February 1876, about 11:30 am: Bell's lawyer brings to the same patent office Bell's patent application for the telephone.  Bell's lawyer requests that it be registered immediately in the cash receipts blotter. 14 February 1876, about 1:30 pm: Approximately two hours later Elisha Gray's patent caveat is registered in the cash blotter. Although his caveat was not a full application, Gray could have converted it into a patent application and contested Bell's priority, but did not do so because of advice from his lawyer and his involvement with acoustic telegraphy.  The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell.[5] 7 March 1876: Bell's U.S. Patent, No. 174,465 for the telephone is granted. 10 March 1876: Bell first successfully transmits speech, saying \"Mr. Watson, come here! I want to see you!\" using a liquid transmitter as described in Gray's caveat, and Bell's own electromagnetic receiver. 16 May 1876: Thomas Edison files first patent application for acoustic telegraphy for which U.S. patent 182,996 was granted October 10, 1876. 25 June 1876: Bell exhibits his telephone at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where it draws enthusiastic reactions from Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil and Lord Kelvin, attracting the attention of the press and resulting in the first announcements of the invention to the general public. 10 August 1876: Alexander Graham Bell makes the world's first long-distance telephone call, over a distance of about 6 miles, between Brantford and Paris, Ontario, Canada. 1876: Hungarian Tivadar Puskas invents the telephone switchboard exchange (later working with Edison). 9 October 1876: Bell makes the first two-way long-distance telephone call between Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. October 1876: Edison tests his first carbon microphone. 1877: The first experimental Telephone Exchange in Boston. 20 January 1877: Edison \"first [succeeds] in transmitting over wires many articulated sentences\" using carbon granules as a pressure-sensitive varying resistance under the pressure of a diaphragm.[6] 30 January 1877: Bell's U.S. Patent No. 186,787 is granted for an electromagnetic telephone using permanent magnets, iron diaphragms, and a call bell. 4 March 1877: Emile Berliner invents a microphone based on \"loose contact\" between two metal electrodes, an improvement on Reis' Telephone, and in April 1877 files a caveat of an invention in process. April 1877: A telephone line connects the workshop of Charles Williams, Jr., located in Boston, to his house in Somerville, Massachusetts at 109 Court Street in Boston, where Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson had previously experimented with their telephone. The telephones became No. 1 and 2 in the Bell Telephone Company.[7] 27 April 1877: Edison files telephone patent applications. U.S. patents (Nos. 474,230, 474,231 and 474,232) were awarded to Edison in 1892 over the competing claims of Alexander Graham Bell, Emile Berliner, Elisha Gray, Amos Dolbear, J.W. McDonagh, G.B.

The strategy behind rational drug design is to develop a new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications.[8] An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine,[7] which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs.[5] Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome were associated with the use of the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype.[5] Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs).[5][9] Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine),[4][8] as demonstrated in table 1.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1200, "text": "Fluoxetine"}], "id": "english-6928331600011290832-4", "question": "What was the first drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression?"}]}], "title": "Development and discovery of SSRI drugs"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A. planci has a very wide Indo-Pacific distribution.

In testing one month prior to the 2005 Italian Grand Prix, Juan Pablo Montoya of the McLaren-Mercedes F1 team recorded a record top speed of 372.6km/h (231.5mph),[29] which got officially recognised by the FIA as the fastest speed ever achieved by an F1 car, even though it was not set during an officially sanctioned session during a race weekend. In the 2005 Italian GP Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen of McLaren-Mercedes was recorded at 370.1km/h (229.9mph). This record was broken at the 2016 Mexican Grand Prix by Williams driver Valtteri Bottas, whose top speed in race conditions was 372.54km/h (231.48mph).[30][31] However, even though this information was shown in FIA's official monitors, the FIA is yet to accept it as an official record. Bottas had previously set an even higher record top speed during qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, recording a speed of 378.035km/h (234.9mph), albeit through the use of slipstream drafting. This top speed is yet to be confirmed by any official method as currently the only source of this information is the Williams team's Twitter post,[32] while the FIA's official speed trap data measured Bottas's speed at 366.1 kmh in that instance.[33] At the moment Montoya's speed of 372.6 kmh (231.5mph) is still regarded as the official record, even though it was not set during a sanctioned session.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 934, "text": "372.6km/h (231.5mph)"}], "id": "english--1401397023240222162-53", "question": "How fast can a Formula 1 car go?"}]}], "title": "Formula One car"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The U.S. state of Louisiana is divided into 64 parishes (French: paroisses) in the same manner that 48 other states of the United States are divided into counties, and Alaska is divided into boroughs.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 44, "text": "64"}], "id": "english-4998935980896776205-1", "question": "How many parishes are there in Louisiana?"}]}], "title": "List of parishes in Louisiana"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Communist rule in the Hungarian People's Republic came to an end in 1989.
